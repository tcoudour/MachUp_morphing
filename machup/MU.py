class MachUp:
    """The MachUp model.

    The MachUp model combines a model for calculating the aerodynamics
    on propellers with a separate model for calculating the aerodynamics
    on lifting surfaces such as wings. The integration of these two 
    models allows a user to construct an aircraft with multiple propellers
    and wings and then analyze its aerodynamics as a whole.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputfile : string
        The filename for a .json file input that provides all of the
        necessary information about the airplane.

    inputAirplane : machup.plane
        Plane object which provides necessary geometry information to
        lifting line algorithm.

    Returns
    -------
    MachUp
        Returns the newly created MachUp object.

    Examples
    --------
    A simple use case is shown below
